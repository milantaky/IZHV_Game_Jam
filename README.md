# IZHV_Game_Jam
Final project for Introduction to Game Development 

# Goal 
My idea is to build an Art Maker Game.
The game is simple. You will be creating a painting using a set of brushes and sprays.
There will also be some color exploding boxes to give it a bit of randomness.

# Controls
- A: Move Left
- D: Move Right
- W: Move Forward
- S: Move Backwards
- LMB: Paint
- Nums (0-3): Switch Tools
- R: Reset canvas
- C: Reset view
